## Overview

Interactive Front-End Application developed by a group of 3 people.

What solutions the app (Big-Night-In) provides?

- A simple, easy to use tool to **help users decide what to watch** during their big night in.
- A tool that takes the user input to **generate a suggestion of what to watch based on certain criteria**.
- A tool that not only populates a movie suggestion, but also **provides information about the suggested movie and a rating**.
- A tool that also **suggests a take out meal suggestion based on the users location** (stored in users local storage).

## User Story

```
AS A person that wants to spend a night in at home

I WANT to receive a recommendation for something to watch and eat

SO THAT I don’t waste time searching for these myself and aimlessly end up scrolling for hours
```

## Acceptance Criteria

The app meets the following requirements:

- Uses Bootstrap.
- Deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Interactive (accept and respond to user input).
- Uses at least two server-side APIs links to an external site.
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Is responsive to different screen size.
- Have a polished UI.

## Wireframes/Prototype

In the project planning stage using **Figma** we created layout of the page for both Desktop and Smartphone screen.
